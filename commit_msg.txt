feat: World Model engine, 8-GPU reranker, model bakeoff, 100% regression

Major features:
- World Model engine with mechanism graph (loops, interventions, simulator)
- 8-GPU CrossEncoder reranker trained on 5,600 pairs (DataParallel)
- Model bakeoff: GPT-5.1 selected as default (95.6% PASS_FULL rate)
- Regression suite: 100% pass rate on 10 critical questions

Key fixes:
- False abstention: seed retrieval floor for global synthesis questions
- Policy intent: SYSTEM_LIMITS_POLICY now achieves PASS_FULL
- Seed floor SQL: fixed chunk.entity_type/entity_id join for pillars
- Contract gate: added system_limits_policy intent detection

New components:
- apps/api/core/world_model/ (loop reasoner, intervention planner, simulator)
- apps/api/retrieve/reranker.py (CrossEncoder integration)
- apps/api/core/answer_contract.py (deterministic contract checking)
- eval/ (bakeoff datasets, regression tests, reports)
- scripts/train_reranker_dp.py (multi-GPU training)

CI/Tooling:
- make ci: runs tests + regression gate
- make eval-regression: regression test suite
- make reranker-ab: A/B test for reranker

Configuration:
- RERANKER_ENABLED=true (production default)
- gpt-5.1 as default model, gpt-5-chat as fallback
